# OCR-Enhanced Messaging Platform with Attention-Based Language Translation

## Week 1: Scope and Objective

### **Scope**
The scope of this project is to develop an advanced chat application that enables **real-time multilingual communication** and integrates **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** functionality. This platform is designed to cater to users speaking different languages, enhancing communication through the following features:

1. **Language Preference Management:**
   - Allow users to select their preferred language during registration.
   - Store user preferences in Firebase for personalized interactions.

2. **Real-Time Translation:**
   - Facilitate immediate translation of text messages between users with different language preferences using an **attention-based sequence-to-sequence model**.

3. **OCR Integration:**
   - Enable users to upload images within the chat.
   - Extract text from uploaded images using **OCR technology**.
   - Translate the extracted text into the recipient's preferred language.

4. **Usability and Scalability:**
   - Provide a seamless and responsive chat interface.
   - Optimize the system for real-time performance and scalability to support multiple users and languages.

5. **Cost-Efficiency:**
   - Use Firebase for real-time database storage and user management.
   - Minimize storage costs by dynamically retrieving and translating messages instead of saving translations.
